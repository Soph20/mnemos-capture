/**
 * Regression coverage for orphaned captures.
 *
 * extractCapture used to do `JSON.parse(raw) as ExtractedCapture` — a cast,
 * not a check. When the model had nothing to work with (a bare URL it could
 * not fetch) it returned nulls for slug/title/coreIdea, the cast let them
 * through, and buildIndexRow threw on `.slice()` of null. By then the capture
 * file was already written, so the file existed with no index row and could
 * not be found by search. Two captures in mnemos-knowledge ended up that way:
